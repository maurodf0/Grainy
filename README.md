== Description ==
Description: Simple yet powerful Full Block Theme for all blog developed to take full advantage of WordPress's Full Site Editing capabilities. Came out with patterns and different styles to match your web site. Create your own website with Grainy without coding editing all its parts, including footer, header, template and all the single elements. Why Grainy? Because this theme borns with the idea of a noise pattern into the background. that pattern "granuloso" in Italian, grainy means exactly this.
